                  Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American
                  rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is often cited as
                  one of the most influential rappers of his generation. Aside
                  from his solo career, he is also a member of the hip hop
                  supergroup Black Hippy alongside his former Top Dawg
                  Entertainment (TDE) labelmates Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and
                  Schoolboy Q.

                <p>
                  Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers is the fifth studio album by
                  American rapper Kendrick Lamar, released on May 13, 2022, by
                  PGLang, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), Aftermath Entertainment,
                  and Interscope Records. The double album is Lamar's first
                  studio album release since Damn (2017), his first album
                  release under his creative collective PGLang, and his final
                  project with TDE (under which he released four albums and was
                  one of their flagship artists). Upon release, Mr. Morale & the
                  Big Steppers was met with widespread acclaim from critics, who
                  praised Lamar's lyricism and the album's scope, although a few
                  found it inconsistent. The album has so far spawned three
                  singles: "N95", "Silent Hill", and "Die Hard". It debuted at
                  number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Lamar's fourth US
                  number-one album.

                  Throughout his first release in exactly 1,855 days, Kendrick
                  muses on his many achievements covering a 19-year career, as
                  well as the pitfalls of fame. He goes into great detail about
                  his spending habits, real estate investments, luxury vehicles,
                  and jewelry; he also discusses entering therapy to deal with
                  mental health issues.

                  “N95” is the second track on Kendrick Lamar's fifth and final
                  studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big
                  Steppers. The song's title refers to N95 face masks, which
                  have been one of the several key tools adopted to contrast the
                  COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout this track, Kendrick addresses
                  futile and superficial coping mechanisms, while pointing out
                  at the facades a lot of people have acquired, which he also
                  discussed on the previous song from the album, “United in
                  Grief”.

                <p>
                  “Worldwide Steppers” is the third track on Kendrick Lamar's
                  fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr.
                  Morale & The Big Steppers. The track features a brief
                  introduction by Kodak Black. The ensuing chorus and verse
                  provide some insight into his relatively seclusive life, one
                  where he has spent nearly 5 years detached from the public.
                  During this time, he has fathered two children, who seem to
                  have grounded him. Other aspects of this track include
                  religion, which Lamar claims lifted him out of “writer's
                  block” to create this album.

                ></iframe>
                <p>
                  In a very Nipsey track, Kendrick opens up about his
                  insecurities and struggles involving honesty and sharing in a
                  relationship. He is having doubts as to whether he will still
                  be loved if he opens up, an uncertainty probably built by past
                  traumas and relationships. However, by the end of the song, he
                  accepts that he must overcome his past to reach his best form
                  and be a full-time lover, by letting go and realizing the
                  current relationship is not as empty and this lover is not as
                  unloyal as the ones in the past.

                ></iframe>
                <p>
                  Kendrick explores the long-ingrained, toxic masculinity that
                  is passed on from generation to generation, sometimes actively
                  by a father who is present, and other times through the
                  absence of a father figure. A momentous theme on this project,
                  Lamar goes in depth about his struggles with mental health,
                  opening the song with a short sketch where his partner,
                  Whitney Alford, tells him to seek counseling from Eckhart
                  Tolle. He goes on to cite “daddy issues” as a reason for gang
                  culture among young Black men in the broader community.

                  Morale and the Big Steppers, Kodak Black discusses the
                  numerous struggles he encountered on his journey to success in
                  the rap industry. While also expressing that even though he is
                  in a much better situation in life compared to his situation
                  years prior, he is still fearful of his problems in the past
                  and consequently behaves in a way that is cautious towards
                  them.

                  “Rich Spirit” depicts an irreverent Kendrick talking about his
                  own qualities while trying to stand firm against the criticism
                  against him. Kendrick utilizes ethereal melodies and portrays
                  a different side to Lamar's customary approach while also
                  debating mortality, loyalty, narcissism, and other themes.

                  On “We Cry Together,” Kendrick and Taylour Paige take opposite
                  sides in an ugly couple's dispute that sees them hurling
                  insults at one another for nearly six minutes. Another
                  interpretation of the song is that Taylour represents the
                  state of hip-hop, hating Kendrick for being absent for the
                  last five years—his previous album, DAMN., was released in
                  April 2017.

                  10th track overall from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. The
                  track focuses on Kendrick calling out a once-significant
                  person in his life who he loves to prove wrong. Throughout the
                  song, Kendrick steps into a new chapter of his life, as a
                  result of feeling obligated to open up more in his
                  relationship.

                  In “Crown,” the Compton native Kendrick Lamar gives us insight
                  into his psyche, portraying his deeply conflicted inner-self
                  while performing over a prominent sample from the 2016 song
                  “Through the Night,” by Duval Timothy. While rapping about his
                  contrasting feelings about being seen and doing his best as a
                  leader in his community while obviously not being able to
                  please everyone, Kendrick also speaks about love for his
                  family, his fans and for himself and makes references to
                  William Shakespeare's Henry IV throughout the song's melodic
                  refrain.

                  Kodak's appearance on Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers began to
                  circulate, however, this wasn't confirmed until the official

                  On “Savior,” Kendrick teams up with Sam Dew and Baby Keem to
                  inform his listeners about the brokenness of society. The song
                  comes directly after “Savior (Interlude),” which Baby Keem
                  also plays a central role on. In the intro, Kendrick sets the
                  tone by reminding those who look up to public figures that
                  they are only human. Each verse tackles a different subject:
                  in the first verse, he addresses a host of racial issues; in
                  the second, he talks about COVID-19 and political correctness;
                  and, in the third verse, he discusses his own flaws and
                  struggles.

                  “Mother I Sober” is the eighth track on disc two of Kendrick
                  Lamar's fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg
                  Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, and the
                  seventeenth track overall. It features Beth Gibbons on the
                  Chorus and Sam Dew on the outro, respectively. Lamar instantly
                  opens up with heartfelt and personal lyrics where he battles
                  his trauma head-on. At the start of the song, Lamar details
                  his upbringing and the trauma associated with it. He details
                  his mother's experience with sexual abuse and then her fear
                  that Lamar may be experiencing assault as well. Later on,
                  Lamar asserts he was never subject to drug addiction, rather
                  it was lust itself. Lamar then feels a sense of despair and
                  hopelessness as he opens up to cheating on his, at the time
                  fiancé. He compares this action in the same vein as his
                  mother's abuser. He then describes the instantaneous remorse
                  and guilt he has to this day. Shortly after, Lamar broadens
                  his viewpoint on the toxic sex culture faced by the Black
                  community and how it must be brought to attention. He
                  exclaims, however, that sexual abuse many Black children face
                  can be a root cause of this culture as our society doesn't
                  feel like a safe space. This is what is later coined as the
                  “generational curse” Black people face. Towards the end of the
                  song, it is then where Kendrick metaphorically frees himself
                  and everyone affected by the toxicity through the use of
                  transparency, pride, and positivity, thus aiming to break the
                  “generational curse.”

                  Steppers. He discusses the pressures of fame and the dichotomy
                  of living selfishly despite his modest image. He also alludes
                  to his newborn daughter, depicted on the album's cover art,
                  before reiterating statements about his ongoing therapy; this
