                  Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known
                  professionally as Logic, is an American rapper and record
                  producer. He has released seven studio albums and received two
                  Grammy Award nominations. Logic's first two studio albums —
                  Under Pressure (2014) and The Incredible True Story (2015) —
                  both peaked within the top five on the U.S. Billboard 200 and
                  were certified gold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No Pressure is the sixth studio album and seventh professional
                  project by Maryland rapper Logic, and serves as a sequel to
                  his 2014 debut, Under Pressure. In a similar fashion to how
                  his 2018 project YSIV was teased, Logic released a “No
                  Pressure Freestyle” in August 2019 that served as the first
                  mention of this album and included lines found in songs on the
                  project. Much like Under Pressure and the album that followed
                  in 2015, The Incredible True Story, No Pressure features the
                  ‘AI assistant’ Thalia in a narrative role similar to that of
                  Under Pressure. Logic returned from a social media hiatus to
                  announce that No Pressure would be released in just over a
                  week and serve as his final project.

                  “No Pressure” is the title track and opening song to Logic’s
                  seventh studio album, a sequel to October 2014’s Under
                  Pressure. The intro features Thalia, a familiar voice to Logic
                  fans, as well as a chopped up narration by filmmaker Orson
                  Welles, who Logic uses throughout the album; for example, he
                  also appears on the final track, “Obediently Yours.” Logic
                  dives back into his homelife in Maryland and provides multiple
                  callbacks for fans of Under Pressure. He also speaks on the
                  crack epidemic that plagued the United States in the ‘80s and
                  '90s, and how his own father fell victim to drug addiction. He
                  elaborated on this topic throughout the aforementioned album’s
                  title track, “Under Pressure,” rapping from the perspective of
                  his dad: And on the real, I’m tryin' so hard not to bug you
                  But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use? I’m
                  two years clean, no longer a fiend Yeah, I’m 57, but I feel 19

                  “Hit My Line” involves Logic preaching to God about the
                  troublesome things that he witness in his day-to-day life.
                  While drawing from previous life experiences during
                  adolescence, he also speaks on his life since becoming famous—
                  a theme that was present on the previous track as well. Logic
                  also speaks on gang violence as well as throwing in a couple
                  of nods to Chicago rapper-producer Kanye West whom he cited as
                  a major influence in his production game on “Perfect.”

                <p>
                  “GP4” finds Logic reminiscing on his come up and how he
                  reached successes despite coming from a low-income background.
                  On the chorus, Logic pays homage to OutKast through
                  interpolation of their 1996 song, “Elevators (Me & You).” This
                  track also serves as the fourth installment in Logic’s Growing
                  Pains series—the last installment was “Growing Pains III” from
                  his debut album, Under Pressure. Interestingly, Logic also
                  sampled OutKast on “Growing Pains II.”

                <p>
                  On “Celebration,” Logic compares his life growing up to the
                  heights he has reached and celebrates by flexing his status.
                  The song itself is an interpolation of “Celebration” by Kanye
                  West. This isn’t the only track on the album that is a
                  callback to one of West’s songs, as “Heard Em Say” is also an
                  interpolation of Kanye’s song of the same name. He enlists
                  help from Silas — a Maryland rapper he signed to Bobby Boy
                  records in 2019 — who also discusses how his life has changed
                  in just one year under the tutelage of one of his idols.

                  Logic covers familiar topics on this open mic-themed song,
                  such as his rapping skills, family history, and music career.
                  He also uses similar lyrics and samples from his debut album,
                  October 2014’s Under Pressure; including July 1976’s “Do That
                  Stuff” by Parliament, originally found on the aforementioned
                  project’s title track. The second half of this song title
                  refers to the name of the spaceship operated by protagonists
                  Thomas and Khai on Logic’s second studio album, November
                  2015’s The Incredible True Story. Continuing with the concept
                  of utilizing various elements from his debut, the interlude
                  features a sample which can be heard in the background of the
                  song “I’m Gone.” It also contains part of the the intro from
                  “Warm it up,” off of his seventh mixtape, March 2018’s Bobby
                  Tarantino II.

                  “Soul Food II” is the second installment in Logic’s Soul Food
                  series, the first appearing in his October 2014 debut album,
                  Under Pressure. Logic spends the first half of the song
                  speaking on how he has evolved as a person and an artist since
                  the first “Soul Food” dropped, as is evident in his first
                  lines. In the second half, Logic raps about the storyline of
                  his second album, The Incredible True Story, where main
                  protagonists Thomas and Kai are on the quest for the planet
                  Paradise. As explained in Logic’s Twitch livestream listening
                  party for the album, this is how the original “Soul Food” was
                  supposed to sound: "The first time we did it I couldn’t find
                  the person who owned the sample… This song, six years ago,
                  this is how it was supposed to sound. What you guys are
                  listening to right now is not what […] you were supposed to
                  hear the first time".

                  On “Perfect,” the shortest and lone ‘turn-up’ record on No
                  Pressure, Logic switches up to some braggadocios rapping as he
                  speaks on his success in life and as an artist. As mentioned
                  on his Twitch listening party, Logic explains: "I flex, I
                  swag, I do all this other shit, to bring a message in
                  literally the last bar".

                  On “man i is,” Logic talks about his youth and how he managed
                  to find his way into rap over a soulful backdrop. He also nods
                  to the artists he listened to as a child and during his
                  come-up, who all helped develop him into the man he is today.
                  Logic’s own in-house producer, 6ix, based the sound around a
                  sample of Tarika Blue’s 1977 record, “Dreamflower,” and lifted
                  the horns from OutKast’s “SpottieOttieDopaliscious” to form
                  the instrumental for this track. He also chopped up Pimp C’s
                  “Knockin' Doorz Down” to create the intro. He previously used
                  this song on 2011’s “Addiction.” It’s worth noting that Tarika
                  Blue’s record was similarly sampled by Erykah Badu on November
                  2000’s, “Didn’t Cha Know,” which led to legal disputes. In
                  fact, Logic had to ask for Badu’s permission to use the
                  sample, which he also notes on the album’s third track, “GP4”:
                  "I just texted Erykah Badu To let her know what I’m gon' to do
                  Sample “Dreamflower” by Tarika Blue" Interestingly, Logic
                  previously sampled “Didn’t Cha Know” on his 2018 track,
                  “Indica Badu,” as well.

                <p>
                  “DadBod” is Logic’s way of poking fun at people who want him
                  to go back to his early rap days such as this album’s
                  predecessor, Under Pressure, where he raps about his tough
                  upbringing. Logic explains to the listener that he has evolved
                  past that type of rapping since he no longer experiences these
                  things. He has a new child, a loving wife and his life is
                  generally more mundane now than it was in the past. The term
                  “DadBod” itself is a meme in popular culture, simply being a
                  physical physique that is relatively slim but not strong or
                  toned at all. Logic is symbolically taking on this “average”
                  role for his listeners and his son. A music video was released
                  on July 27, 2020. The video shows him going through his daily
                  life such as walking with his newborn, playing games and
                  hanging out with his wife.

                  On “5 Hooks,” Logic talks about how he started from nothing
                  but nonetheless, his first album made the earth shake. The
                  track name is a reflection on how No Pressure contains just
                  five hooks throughout the project. This song samples “Grown Up
                  Calls” by Toro y Moi, which Logic referenced in a phone call
                  during the outro of the previous track, “DadBod.”

                  On “Dark Place,” Logic opens up about his mental health. From
                  the hate he takes online to feelings that he may never reach
                  the heights listeners put his earlier works on, Logic simply
                  admits that sometimes you simply are sad — and that’s ok.
                  Logic has touched on this subject multiple times in his music
                  before, such as on his April 2017 single “1-800-273-8255,”
                  named after the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or
                  “Anziety,” where he depicts his personal struggles with
                  anxiety.

                  On “A2Z,” Logic teaches his son — Little Bobby — the alphabet.
                  In Part I, each of his bars throughout the song hit on each
                  letter in the alphabet whether it be direct or subliminal.
                  Logic uses an old, embarrassing recording from 2005 — his
                  first song — in Part II in an attempt to show people what he
                  really started out as.

                  “Heard Em Say” is a motivation track from Logic that seeks to
                  use his story to empower the listener. The song is an ode to
                  Kanye West—one of Logic's greatest influences—as he released a
                  track with Adam Levine in 2005 under the same name.

                  “Obediently Yours” is the No Pressure outro for Logic that
                  samples the August 11, 1946 episode of the “Orson Welles
                  Commentaries,” which is related to Issac Woodard Jr, a black
                  veteran who was beaten and blinded by a white police officer.
                  Given the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 that swept the
                  world before and continued on after this album’s release, this
                  commentary sample paints a picture that there is still work to
                  be done for each person to be truly equal.
