                  Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi (born January 30, 1984), better
                  known by his stage name Kid Cudi, is an American rapper,
                  singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He has been
                  widely recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip
                  hop and alternative acts. His lyrics are often
                  autobiographical and describe his childhood hardships of
                  depression, loneliness and alienation, his struggle with
                  alcohol and drugs into adulthood, and themes of spirituality,
                  heartbreak, dissipation and celebration.

                  Man on the Moon III: The Chosen is the seventh studio album by
                  American musician Kid Cudi, released on December 11, 2020 by
                  Republic Records. It is the final installment of Cudi's Man on
                  the Moon trilogy of albums. Thematically, Man on the Moon III
                  is a concept album that finds Cudi in an internal struggle
                  against his evil alter ego, Mr. Rager, in hopes to win back
                  his peace and happiness. As with the previous two installments
                  in the trilogy, the album is divided into separate acts.

                  of Cudi's Man on the Moon trilogy. This intro cleverly
                  interpolates sounds from the opening of the first album in the
                  series while preparing listeners for another "emotional moon
                  landing."

                  Kid Cudi embarks on the final chapter of the Man on the Moon
                  trilogy by reflecting on past struggles and ongoing internal
                  wars. Cudi depicts imagery of a storm stirring up within him,
                  but he can't back down from the fight, despite his fears of
                  crashing. He also mimics Common's narration as a callback to
                  the first Man on the Moon.

                  Kid Cudi raps about the adventures of Mr. Rager, but at the
                  end of the track he seems to awaken from a night of partying
                  with a desire to make a change in his life. He closes the song
                  with a reference to his past life as Mr. Rager, hinting that
                  he is taking his life in a different direction.

                <p>
                  “She Knows This” revisits the theme of Cudi's trippy,
                  occasionally superfluous, sexual parties. A lover at heart,
                  Cudi's focus on his female counterparts is reflected not only
                  in the title of the song, but also repeated throughout the
                  chorus and described in the verses.

                  As the final song of Act I: Return 2 Madness, “Dive” continues
                  the act's theme of alcohol-filled partying, followed by
                  growing feelings of unease. Production is wielded by Dot Da
                  Genius, but features production from others including Anthony
                  Kilhoffer, Aaron Bow, Teddy Walton and Kevin Parker (aka Tame
                  Impala). Cudi and Kilhoffer know each other through their
                  affiliation with Kanye's G.O.O.D. Music record label; and Bow
                  and Walton are often found working together on tracks.

                  “Damaged” is the first track of Act II: The Rager, The Menace,
                  and marks the start of Cudi's spiraling out of control in the
                  plot of the album. The fast-paced life of his tour life,
                  partying and sexual escapades has pushed Cudi into a damaged
                  state of mind.

                  on Earth” portrays Cudi riding high on his rockstar lifestyle.
                  While experiencing the greater things in life and searching
                  for “heaven on Earth”, he is guided by angels in his
                  encounters the devilish behaviors. With its unwavering
                  bassline and Cudi's uncharacteristic ad-libs, the track evokes
                  violent undertones and Cudi seems to be out for blood.

                  “Show Out” is a track of triumph and vigor, which combines
                  related genres of drill and hip hop. Cudi flows in a
                  never-before seen trio alongside the posthumous Brooklyn
                  rapper Pop Smoke and London rapper Skepta. Produced by Cudi's
                  OG team of Dot Da Genius and Plain Pat (as well as Heavy
                  Mellow and Gravez), Cudi returns to his roots both vocally and
                  instrumentally.

                  On “Mr. Solo Dolo III,” Cudi delves into his addiction and
                  struggles stemming from his isolation. Throughout his career,
                  Cudi has been well-known as a pioneer of openness and honesty
                  related to struggles with mental health in hip-hop, a genre
                  that has typically bolstered the male image of high levels of
                  confidence and no invulnerabilities to remark.

                  On “Sad People,” Kid Cudi details the thoughts that plague him
                  at night and his search for inner peace. He illustrates the

                  himself depressed afterward. Despite his sadness, he continues
                  to push his limits, even when he knows it may not be the best
                  for his mental health.

                  2009's “Soundtrack 2 My Life”: "I try and think about myself
                  as a sacrifice Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones

                  “Lord I Know” serves as the closer to both the album and the
                  Man on the Moon trilogy. On the track Cudi ruminates about the
                  trials and tribulations he has faced, and understanding the
                  weight of the message of perseverance he has championed
                  throughout his career on tracks like “Pursuit of Happiness”
                  and “Reborn” It finds Cudi finally content with life and the
                  path that he is on. His daughter Vada closes the album with a
                  short message as well.
