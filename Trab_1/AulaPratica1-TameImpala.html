                  Tame Impala is the psychedelic music project of Australian
                  multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.[6] In the recording
                  studio, Parker writes, records, performs, and produces all of
                  the project's music. As a touring act, Tame Impala consists of
                  Parker (guitar, vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar, synthesiser),
                  Jay Watson (synthesiser, vocals, guitar), Cam Avery (bass
                  guitar, vocals), and Julien Barbagallo (drums, vocals). The
                  group has a close affiliation with fellow Australian
                  psychedelic rock band Pond, sharing members and collaborators,
                  including Nick Allbrook, formerly a live member of Tame
                  Impala. Originally signed to Modular Recordings, Tame Impala
                  is now signed to Interscope Records in the United States and
                  Fiction Records in the UK.

                  Currents is the third studio album by Australian musical
                  project Tame Impala. It was released on 17 July 2015 by
                  Modular Recordings and Universal Music Australia. In the
                  United States it was released by Interscope Records and
                  Fiction Records, while Caroline International released it in
                  other international regions. Like the project's previous two
                  albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and
                  produced by Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker mixed the
                  music and recorded all instruments by himself; the album
                  featured no other collaborators.

                  On the opening track of Tame Impala's third record, Currents,
                  Kevin Parker introduces the album's theme of “letting go” and
                  allowing nature to take its course, merging Tame Impala's
                  signature psychedelic rock sound with an extended electronic
                  breakdown. This theme is where the album derives its title, as
                  Parker stated that the currents he refers to are “unstoppable
                  forces” that lead to personal transformation.

                <p>
                  “Nangs” is a wobbly, disorienting track named after the
                  Australian slang term for canisters filled with nitrous oxide
                  (N2O), a compound gas used in cars to boost speed and
                  transmission, or laughing gas. Nangs are occasionally used as
                  a recreational drug; in the United States, they are known as
                  whippets. The song's introduction sounds like a balloon filled
                  with N2O being inhaled, which is the method used to get the
                  gas into your system. The track does a good job of emulating
                  the woozy, undulating feeling of being high on N2O.

                <p>
                  Much like album opener, “Let It Happen,” “The Moment” focuses
                  on going with the flow and living mindfully, but with the
                  added element of learning to be impulsive and make crucial
                  decisions when the time is right. On Currents, this track
                  delivers a jolt of positivity after the trip-addled
                  existential dread of “Nangs,” mirroring how one must continue
                  onward despite periods of doubt.

                <p>
                  On “Yes I'm Changing,” Kevin Parker sings straight from the
                  heart about his very public break-up with Melody Prochet. The
                  lyrics are perhaps so stream-of-consciousness that he doesn't
                  remember writing them. According to an April 2015 NME article,
                  it was: …a weird experience, because it was like it was
                  someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it.
                  On this track, it starts to become clearer that this album is
                  specifically about the loss of a lover and the end of an era,
                  but also the beginning of something mysterious and new.

                  “Eventually” is the fourth single released from Tame Impala's
                  third album, Currents, following “Let It Happen,” “Cause I'm a
                  Man,” and “Disciples.” It dissects the impending end of a
                  relationship and the difficulties in doing so, attempting to
                  emphasize the latter part of the phrase “short term pain, long
                  term gain.”

                  “Gossip” is Tame Impala's Sixth single from Currents. It was
                  recorded in March, 2012 but later published with the rest of
                  the album tracks in Jul 17, 2015. Currents was preceded by the
                  release of the singles “Let It Happen”, “Cause I'm a Man”,
                  “Disciples” and “Eventually”. Like its predecessors, the album
                  received critical acclaim, and it became the group's best
                  charting release. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, Currents was
                  awarded Best Rock Album and Album of the Year, while at the
                  Annual Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Alternative
                  Music Album. Recording the album soon became an obsession to
                  Parker, as he worked “all day, every day,” growing
                  increasingly isolated. Parker said: "At some point, life
                  outside the studio fades into the distance. That's how I know
                  that I'm into it".

                  “The Less I Know the Better” describes the pain of a man
                  feeling left out in a love triangle, illustrated with a
                  complex arrangement of groovy bass hooks, sensual Rhodes piano
                  chords, and moody synth textures.This track follows the synth
                  vignette “Gossip,” suggesting that the narrator, voiced by
                  Parker, is hearing news about the woman he wants that she is
                  hooking up with someone named Trevor. The song's title comes
                  from his insecurity if people give him the details of his
                  crush's sexual activity, the more it will dominate his
                  thoughts and leave her seemingly defiled in his mind (“is this
                  who you are?”).

                  Tame Impala's third studio album, Currents. While the track
                  was never released as an official radio single, it was
                  unveiled by frontman Kevin Parker during a Reddit AMA on April
                  30, 2015.

                  3rd studio album 'Currents'. The lyrics detail the experience
                  of someone who has been cheated on before and is paranoid
                  about their current partner doing the same. It is unclear
                  whether this person has already cheated on not, due to the
                  unreliable narrator. This person ends up losing their partner
                  due to their paranoia and regrets it, even though they may be
                  right.

                  On the final song of Currents, the narrator admits that his
                  metamorphosis should be read with caution its biggest skeptic
                  is the side of him he left behind. The impulse to change and
                  the fear of changing too much are at odds until the bridge,
                  which suggests some synthesis: “This story ain't so different
                  from the rest.” Change and self-doubt are natural, and in the
                  end the narrator is the same introspective person he was on
                  Innerspeaker and Lonerism. It's a fitting conclusion to an
                  album that both describes personal transformation and embodies
                  it musically, as a radical departure from Kevin Parker's
                  earlier work. Both fans and artist are forced to reconcile the
                  past with the present, and the “realization” that one person
                  can express different aspects of themself at different times
                  “is as good as it gets.”
